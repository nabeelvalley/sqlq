A simple CLI for working with databases during development for quick queries and automation

# Goals

- [x] Manage/migrate own internal DB in the real app (TBC, should work)
- [ ] Support different output formats, e.g. CSV/JSON/Table View
- [ ] Figure out how to distribute the thing
- [ ] Support terminal based UI for doing all of the application features
- [ ] On the fly creation of databases - SQLite, maybe others
